# amiehrealtor

Testing was done prior to migrating Amie Hathaway's realtor website to a new layout in order to identify defects that could
potentially carry over into the new layout.

This test cycle was designed only to address parts of the site used by clients and potential clients (not the realtor
or other admin user).

Excluded from these tests are the two different 'Contact Me' forms in the site. These were excluded so as to avoid sending
unreasonable amounts of requests to an already busy realtor. The forms were, however, tested manually with the realtor's
permission.
